<p>Have you ever tried to pinpoint the construction date of a country cupboard? The stylistic techniques used to date formal furniture such as Chippendale and Hepplewhite simply does not work for American country and primitive furniture. Country furniture does have its styles based predominately on religion and region. The catholic French and the Irish built cupboards with bold mouldings, cut out feet, raised panels and they painted their cupboards in bright colours. The puritan New England cabinetmakers built simple unadorned cupboards painted in drab colours.</p><p>The Shakers are well known for their simple but elegant furniture. Furniture built in the Midwest and the South is different from New England made pieces.</p><p>The problem with using style to establish the construction date of country and primitive furniture is that regional styles remained unchanged for most of the 19th century. Unable to use style, dealers and collectors have turned to the telltale signs left on the furniture itself by tools and by construction methods. This system is remarkably accurate to within a ten-year period.</p><p>During the Industrial Revolution, the method of making nails, screws, hinges, latches, and of milling lumber changed often. Each change is documented, most are patented. The style of nails changed a dozen times, the hinge changed four times, the screw changed three times, and so did latches and pulls. The methods of working wood also changed during this time. The saw changed, moulding styles changed, mortising changed.</p><p>Since it is impossible for any item to be older than the technology that made it possible, a chronological system of the advancement of cabinetmaking technology can be used to establish construction dates to within a few years.</p><p>The up and down saw leaves marks on wood that look like this |||||||||||||. The circular saw leaves marks on wood that look like this ))))))))). The pit saw leaves marks on wood that look like this ///////////.</p><p>The pit saw is a two-man powered saw used in America before 1680 to cut logs into boards. After 1700, its major use was as a large jigsaw to shape knees, ribbing, and planking for ships.</p><p>The up-and-down saw, was used in this country from the 1680s until early in the 1900s. Therefore, most boards used in the construction of early cupboards show signs of being cut with an up-and-down saw.</p><p>The circular saw although introduced in the mid 1850s could not be made big enough and powerful enough to cut lumber of the size used in furniture construction until 1880. The circular saw was limited to cutting thin pieces of wood such as shingles, clapboards, and laths until the early 1900s. Cupboards and other furniture in which the large size boards used in their construction are circular saw cut can date to 1880, but usually date after 1900.</p><p>The rough sawed lumber used in furniture construction was smoothed with either a hand held plane, or a planing machine. The hand held plane was used in this country from the beginning until after 1900. Planing machines were experimented with early in the 1800s. Two early experiments are the Woodworth planer in 1824 and the Daniels planer in 1834. However, a perfected machine was not developed until 1860. Lawsuits over patent rights prevented its use until 1880. Machine plane marks are of some use in dating cupboards made as early as 1860, but machine plane marks usually suggest a construction date of 1880 or later.</p><p>The introduction of the modern looking butt hinge used to hold doors on cupboards dates to 1820. Before 1820, hinges were made one at a time by a blacksmith. The first butt hinges were made out of cast iron. They were thick and heavy. By 1840, cast iron hinges became thinner as manufacturers tried to squeeze more hinges out of each pound of iron. By 1880, the use of cast iron in the making of butt hinges was discontinued in favor of stamped steel.</p><p>The common wood screw underwent a major change in 1846 when T. J. Sloan of New York City invented the first machine to mass-produce this item. Sloan holds many patents for cutting threads, shaping points, and forming the heads of screws.Before 1846, all screws were handmade and the slot in the top of the screw was hand cut with a hacksaw. Seldom was the cut placed exactly in the centre. Because the new machine made screw was inexpensive, it was readily accepted by cabinetmakers. Items made after 1846 are made using this new screw.</p><p>For the first ten years of production, machine made screws were made with no slot in their head. The slot still had to be cut by hand with a hacksaw. Country furniture made with these screws can easily be dated to the ten-year period 1846-1856.The Mercer Museum in Doylestown, Pennsylvania has samples of Sloan’s screws on display. The Mercer library contains materials on both machine made screws and methods of cutting screws by hand.</p><p>In 1871, cast iron latches became available to cabinetmakers. After the introduction of the cast iron latch, most cabinetmakers used this new feature in place of the little wooden turnstile that had been used for centuries.</p><p>In the South and Midwest, hand-cast brass latches were in use before 1850. These early latches were inlaid into cabinet doors rather than being attached to the surface, as were the later cast iron latches.</p><p>Dealers who specialize in country and primitive furniture have depended on the above methods (plus the study of nails) for dating their antiques. Many dealers feel that the technological system is superior to the stylistic system. Furniture styles linger for years. New technologies, because they bring cheaper prices or faster methods, are accepted quickly – usually within a year or two.</p><p>The Dating of Old Houses, a paper prepared by Dr. Henry C. Mercer, contains photographs, drawings, and patent information on nails, hinges, screws, hardware, planing machines, etc. Call the Mercier Museum, Doylestown, Pennsylvania (215-345-0210) during business hours for information on reprints by The Bucks County Historical Society.</p><picture>

<p>The hinge above (broken) is made of cast iron and measures 1/8 inch thick. This hinge dates to about 1820. The hinge in the middle is thinner and was removed from a cupboard made about 1860. This hinge measures 1/16 inch in thickness. The hinge on the right is a modern hinge. It was removed from a house when the kitchen cabinets were undated. The hinge dates to 1940. It is 1/32 inch in thickness and made out of stamped steel.Stamped steel hinges began to appear in 1885.I began collecting up and down, pit, bolt, and early circular saws to study saw construction and the marks each type of saw left on the wood it cut. The four saws on the left are waterwheel powered up and down saws. They leave a down cutting mark between 3/8 and 5/8 inch wide and one up drag mark 1/32 inch wide as the blade is pulled up. The circular saw was used to cut clapboards before 1880. The blade is thick, spins slowly, and makes a wide (3/8 inch) cut. Modern circular saws spin fast and cut very little wood on each revolution. The next three saws are bolt saws used by some mills to square both ends of a log before cutting boards. The three saws on the right are two-man powered pit saws used to handsaw logs into boards. The tall pit saw was used in a shipyard as a large jigsaw to shape timber for ship construction. For the purpose of scale and size, my garage is eight feet – six inches tall.</p><picture>

<p>The screw above was handmade. The slot in the top was hand cut by a hacksaw. The screw on the right was machine made. The slot in its head was cut by a machine. There are many differences between a handmade and a machine-made screw. The shank of a handmade screw does not taper. The point of the handmade screw is blunt. By contrast, the shaft of the machine made screw tapers to a point. The threads are cut evenly and they pitch at a different angle than those of the handmade screw. The first machine made screw dates to 1846. The first machine made screw with a machine cut slot in its head dates to 1856.</p><p>Jay D. Edwards and Tom Wells, researchers from Louisiana State University, have published a working paper on historical nail technology. Their work chronicles the development of nail technology from 1720 to 1900. The study was undertaken to help historians pinpoint the precise construction dates of historical buildings. The authors’ systematic chronological presentation of the subject includes many photographs and drawings that transform complicated technological research into an easy to read and understand subject.</p><p>They begin by explaining the three ways in which nails are made: by forging, by cutting, and by drawing. Forged nails are hand shaped one at a time by a blacksmith. After the shaft is shaped, it is placed into a heading tool and the head is formed with several blows of a hammer. This process produces what is commonly called the Rose Head nail.</p><p>Cut nails are made in a two-step process. First, blanks are cut from flat strips of iron. Second, the nail is held tight while the head is formed by the blow of a mechanical heading device.</p><p>Drawn nails are made by pulling wire through a series of dies. Die sizes, of course, determines nail size. The wire nail is then held in a clamp and headed in a separate process. Although drawn nails were experimented with in France in 1820 and in New York State in 1855, it was the development of Bessemer steel in 1885 that made the drawn nail feasible.<br>Edwards and Wells have sorted the many types of nails into twelve easy to understand groupings. Groups 1 and 2 are nails made entirely by hand. These nails are the ones that antique dealers call Rose Head nails. The reason for dividing handmade nails into two groupings is that two different forming methods were used. A close inspection of a handmade nail will often reveal the method used and therefore its approximate age.</p><p>At the other end of this scale is group 10, a square cut steel nail introduced in 1885 that had a short life span because it was almost immediately replaced by the wire nail.</p><p>Groups 11 and 12 are a detailed examination of the modern wire nail that came into use in 1880 and by 1900 had displaced the cut square nail.</p><p>Of the seven remaining groupings, nails in groups three, four, five, six, and eight are the most common nail used to fasten together American country and American primitive furniture. These nails were cut then headed by machines. There are many easy-to-see differences in each of these five styles. Antique dealers who learn to recognize these five styles of nails can date country and primitive furniture to within a twenty-year period and by combining nail technology with those of hinges, screws, latches, saw marks, and plane marks can pinpoint the actual construction date to within ten years.</p><p>Machinery leaves telltale marks on the piece it makes. In the case of machine cut nails, the shaft of each nail will exhibit cutting marks where the nail is stamped out of a sheet of iron in much the same manner as a cookie cutter works.As the nail cutter slices through the nail plate it rounds the top face and leaves a burr on the bottom (or back) of the nail.Nails cut in this cookie cutter fashion were made from 1790 to 1890.</p><p>The first nail making machines were crude and lacked power. The nail stock had to be turned over because the cutting blades could only cut one side at a time. This process left a cutting burr on each side of the nail shaft.Nails with opposite side burrs were made from 1790 to 1835.</p><p>Besides cutting marks, the nail shaft will also exhibit clamp marks near the head where it was held tightly so that the head could be formed by a heading machine. Early heading machines grabbed the nail from the side and left quite a noticeable imprint when it did so.<br>After 1835, a new method of heading nails was employed and this machine grabbed and held the nail on its face leaving a recognizable indentation on the face.This one bit of information can help date cupboards to before or after 1835. Typically, side pinched nails date 1790 to 1835; face pinched nails date 1835 to 1890.</p><p>Wrought iron has a grain much as wood has a grain. Hand forged Rose Head nails were made with the grain running lengthwise of the nail shaft. However, when nails began to be stamped out of flat sheets of wrought iron, it was found that the cutting machine did not work well with the in-line grain. Therefore, early machine cut nails were cut across the grain. This process produced an inferior nail that could not be clinched but their low cost far out weighed this disadvantage.</p><p>Consequently, from 1790 to 1848 the grain of a machine cut nail runs across rather than with the length of the shaft. In 1848, a new machine was introduced that cut nails, once again, in-line with the grain of wrought iron. This machine was used until steel replaced wrought iron in 1885.</p><p>Using the above information nails can be dated as follows: A cut nail made out of steel dates 1885 and later. A cut nail that has opposite side (face and back) cutting burrs, is side pinched, and has a grain that runs across the shaft dates 1790-1848. A nail that has cutting burrs on the same side, is crossed grained, and side pinched dates 1835-1848. A cut nail that has in-line grain, is faced pinched, and cutting burrs on the same side dates 1848-1885. There are many other combinations, too many to include in an article of this nature. Dealers and collectors should contact Louisiana State University for a copy of this research paper. It is cheap!</p><picture>

<p>Common eight penny nails used in house and furniture construction. The one on the left was hand wrought and hand headed either by a professional nailer or by a blacksmith in the 1700s. Most antique dealers and collectors can easily recognize this style nail (the Rose Head). The nail in the middle was made between 1790 and 1835. The shank of this nail has opposite side cutting burrs because the stock this nail was cut from was rotated 1808 between each cut. The nail is severely side pinched under the head. This deformation was caused by the heading machine clamp pinching the shaft at this point to hold it securely so that the head could be formed. The nail on the right was made between 1835 and 1885. The cutting burrs are on the same side of the nail shaft. Same side burrs are evidence of an improvement in nail technology implemented in 1835. The entire nail was cut in one operation. It was no longer necessary to rotate the stock between each cut. The heading machine grabbed this style nail by the face to hold it so that the head could be formed. Notice there is no side pinching underneath the head.</p><picture>

<p>These nails represent American nail technology from the early 1700s until 1900. These nails look different because they are different. Each type was made by a slightly different process using new technology as it advanced.The ability to identify nails and the period in which they where made makes it possible to date accurately the construction period of anything fastened together with nails. This process works for a chest of drawers, a cupboard, or for a house.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --></div></section><section id="4"
